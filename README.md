# Nerukysiu.lt üö≠ Project Documentation
https://nerukysiu.lt


## Introduction
This is a short overview of the fun little contribution I made to the nerukysiu.lt website. I created 4 different features using `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript` that are accessible on the website now. 

‚ö†Ô∏è __NOTE: Each folder/subfolder consists of just 3 files: `index.html`, `style.css` and `script.js`. I did not structure it any further because I had to paste the code into WordPress as an entire block for it to work.__

## Features
### 1. __AddictionQuiz__

An interactive quiz that assesses users' addiction levels and provides helpful resources for assistance.

### 2. __BodyInteractive__

An interactive representation of the human body, displaying internal organs with gender switch capability. Next to it, there's a timeline that provides information on what happens when someone quits smoking. When you hover on each point in time, it shows specific organs affected in the body.

This feature is split into two parts which are very similar to each other, currently only the `Health` version is live.

### 3. __HelpCenterMap__

An interactive map using Mapbox GL JS, showcasing health centers across Lithuania. Features filtering options and detailed information popups.

### 4. __SavingsCalculator__
An interactive tool that calculates potential savings from quitting smoking, using sliders and input fields.

## Libraries
Libraries that I used are:
- [NoUiSlider Library](https://github.com/leongersen/noUiSlider) (I used it for the sliders, obviously)
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) (used for various icons throughout the project)
- [Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs) (used inside `HelpCenterMap`)

## Credits

The WordPress website was created by the team at [Improvega](https://improvega.com), while the specific features described in this documentation (AddictionQuiz, BodyInteractive, HelpCenterMap, and SavingsCalculator) were independently developed by me.
